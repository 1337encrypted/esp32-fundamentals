# Task Functions

- Each task is a like a small program.
- Its has an entry point and run forever within an infinte loop, and will never exit.
- Task should not be allow to **return** or reach the **end** of the function.
- It should be deleted explicitly.

### Example 

```
void ATaskFunction( void *pvParameters )
{

/* A task will normally be implemented as an infinite loop. */
while(true)
{
    /* The code to implement the task functionality will go here. */
}

vTaskDelete( NULL );
}
```
