## xTaskCreate() prototype

```
BaseType_t xTaskCreate( 
    TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode,
    const char * const pcName,
    uint16_t usStackDepth,
    void *pvParameters,
    UBaseType_t uxPriority,
    TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask
    );
```

| Parameter Name | Returned Value Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| pvTaskCode | The code for the task should be passed here|
| pcName | Task name used during debugging, not used by the freeRTOS scheduler in any way |
| usStackDepth | The value specifies the number of words the stack can hold. For example, if the stack is 32-bits wide and usStackDepth is passed in as 100, then 400 bytes of stack space will be allocated (100 * 4 bytes). |
| pvParameters | Task functions accept a parameter of type pointer to void ( void* ). |
| uxPriority | Priorities can be assigned from 0, which is the lowest priority, to (configMAX_PRIORITIES â€“ 1), which is the highest priority. |
| pxCreatedTask | This is used to pass the handle for the task beign created, its used to change the priority or delete the task. If your application has no use for the task handle, then pxCreatedTask can be set to NULL. |

Returned value There are two possible return values: 
1. `pdPASS`: This indicates that the task has been created successfully.
2. `pdFAIL` : This indicates that the task has not been created because there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to allocate enough RAM to hold the task data structures and stack.

## Examples

### Example 1. Creating tasks

This example demonstrates the steps needed to create two simple tasks

```
void vTask1( void *pvParameters )
{
    const char *pcTaskName = "Task 1 is running\r\n";

    volatile uint32_t ul; /* volatile to ensure ul is not optimized away. */

    while(true)
        {
       
        vPrintString( pcTaskName );      /* Print out the name of this task. */

        for( ul = 0; ul < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ul++ )
        {
            /* Delay for a period. */
        }
    }
}

void vTask2( void *pvParameters )
{
    const char *pcTaskName = "Task 2 is running\r\n";
    volatile uint32_t ul; /* volatile to ensure ul is not optimized away. */

       while(true)
        {
       
        vPrintString( pcTaskName );      /* Print out the name of this task. */

        for( ul = 0; ul < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ul++ )
        {
            /* Delay for a period. */
        }
    }
}

int main( void )
{
    /* Create one of the two tasks. Note that a real application should check
    the return value of the xTaskCreate() call to ensure the task was created
    successfully. */

    BaseType_t xTaskCreateResult1 = xTaskCreate( 
        vTask1,         /* Pointer to the function that implements the task. */
        "Task 1",       /* Text name for the task. This is to facilitate debugging only. */
        1000,           /* Stack depth - small microcontrollers will use muchless stack than this. */
        NULL,           /* This example does not use the task parameter. */
        1,              /* This task will run at priority 1. */
        NULL );         /* This example does not use the task handle. */
    
    
    BaseType_t xTaskCreateResult2 = xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );       

    if (xTaskCreateResult1 == pdPASS && xTaskCreateResult2 == pdPASS) {
        
        vTaskStartScheduler();      // Both tasks created successfully, start the FreeRTOS scheduler
    } 
    else 
    {
        // Handle task creation failure
        // This could be logging an error message, restarting the system, etc.
    }

    /* If all is well then main() will never reach here as the scheduler will now be running the tasks. 
    If main() does reach here then it is likely that there was insufficient heap memory available for the idle
    task to be created.
    Chapter 2 provides more information on heap memory management. */
    
    while(true);
}
```

### Example 2. Using the task parameter

```
void vTaskFunction( void *pvParameters )
{
    char *pcTaskName;
    volatile uint32_t ul; /* volatile to ensure ul is not optimized away. */
  
    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;         /* The string to print out is passed in via the parameter. Cast this to a character pointer. */
    while(true)
    {
        vPrintString( pcTaskName );      /* Print out the name of this task. */
        for( ul = 0; ul < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ul++ )
        {
            /* Delay for a period. */
        }
    }
}

/* Define the strings that will be passed in as the task parameters. 
These are defined const and not on the stack to ensure they remain valid when the tasks are executing. */

static const char *pcTextForTask1 = "Task 1 is running\r\n";
static const char *pcTextForTask2 = "Task 2 is running\r\n";

int main( void )
{
    /* Create one of the two tasks. */
    BaseType_t xTaskCreateResult1 = xTaskCreate( 
        vTaskFunction,              /* Pointer to the function that implements the task. */
        "Task 1",                   /* Text name for the task. This is to facilitate debugging only. */
        1000,                       /* Stack depth - small microcontrollers will use much less stack than this. */
        (void*)pcTextForTask1,      /* Pass the text to be printed into the task using the task parameter. */
        1,                          /* This task will run at priority 1. */
        NULL );                     /* The task handle is not used in this example. */
   
    /* Create the other task in exactly the same way. 
    Note this time that multiple tasks are being created from the SAME task implementation (vTaskFunction). 
    Only the value passed in the parameter is different. 
    Two instances of the same task are being created. */

    BaseType_t xTaskCreateResult2 = xTaskCreate( vTaskFunction, "Task 2", 1000, (void*)pcTextForTask2, 1, NULL );

    if (xTaskCreateResult1 == pdPASS && xTaskCreateResult2 == pdPASS) {
        
        vTaskStartScheduler();      // Both tasks created successfully, start the FreeRTOS scheduler
    } 
    else 
    {
        // Handle task creation failure
        // This could be logging an error message, restarting the system, etc.
    }

    /* If all is well then main() will never reach here as the scheduler will now be running the tasks. 
    If main() does reach here then it is likely that there was insufficient heap memory available 
    for the idle task to be created.
